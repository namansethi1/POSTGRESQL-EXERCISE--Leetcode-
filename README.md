![Crack SQL Interview in 50 Qs](![alt text](image.png))

This repository contains solutions to the **LeetCode SQL Challenges**. I have solved 50 unique SQL problems from LeetCode and uploaded the corresponding queries here.

## About

The collection includes a variety of SQL problems that cover essential concepts such as:

- Joins (Inner, Outer, Left, Right)
- Aggregation (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- Subqueries (Correlated and Non-Correlated)
- Window Functions
- String and Date Manipulations
- Complex Queries (Multiple conditions, Group By, etc.)

Each solution is well-commented to explain the problem, the approach used, and how it is optimized for performance.
